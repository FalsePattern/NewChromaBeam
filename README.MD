# ChromaBeam Rewrite

## This project is no longer in active development!

(inactive) Progress blog: https://falsepattern.com/chromabeam

Warning! You have to play the demo by starting it with a terminal, because input feedback
is text-based with not GUI response!.

Controls:
- R - rotate component clockwise
- Shift+R - rotate component counter-clockwise
- F - flip component(mirror)
- 0,1,2,3,4,5 - Select components
- Left click - Place component / Interact (You can click a gate to invert its switch behaviour)
- Right click - Delete component

!!!No save/load, camera movement or zooming is implemented in the demo!!!

- [ ] User Interface
  - [ ] Text renderer
  - [ ] Keyboard interaction with GUI
  - [ ] Mouse interaction with GUI
- [ ] Modular component system
  - Components system will be modular from the start to avoid issues with implementing mods later on.
  - [ ] Basic modular components functional
    - Emitter, Wall, Gate, Mirror, Splitter components. The minimum for working circuits.
- [ ] Audio
  - OpenAL
- [ ] Save/Load feature
  - This will be done with a 100% custom serializer to avoid issues with nondeterminism and portability
